# Spaceship Texture Improvement Options

Since Stable Diffusion dependencies are not installed, here are alternative approaches to get better spaceship textures:

## Option 1: Use Free High-Quality Texture Resources

### Recommended Texture Sites:
- **CC0 Textures**: https://cc0textures.com/ (Free, no attribution required)
- **FreePBR**: https://freepbr.com/ (Free PBR materials)
- **Texture Haven**: https://texturehaven.com/ (Free HDR textures)
- **OpenGameArt**: https://opengameart.org/ (Game-specific textures)

### For Spaceship Materials, Search For:
- "Metal plating"
- "Tech panel"
- "Sci-fi floor"
- "Industrial ceiling"
- "Control panel"
- "Energy conduit"

## Option 2: Enhance Current Textures

The current textures are likely pixel art style. We can:

1. **Replace them with downloaded high-res versions**
2. **Scale them up with AI upscaling** (if tools available)
3. **Create variations** with image editing software

## Option 3: Install Stable Diffusion Dependencies

To use our custom generator, install:
```bash
pip install diffusers torch transformers accelerate pillow xformers
```

Then run:
```bash
./generate_spaceship_textures.bat
```

## Option 4: Quick Test with Current Textures

Let's first see how the current textures look in the game and then decide if they need improvement.

## Recommended Action

1. Test the game with current textures
2. If they look too pixelated, download better ones from CC0 sources
3. Replace files in `assets/textures/` with same names
4. Hot-reload will pick up changes automatically

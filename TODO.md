### Project Structure Rules 📋
**MANDATORY - All AI assistants must follow these rules:**

1. **Keep Root Clean**: Only essential files in root directory
2. **Cross-Platform First**: No platform-specific scripts in root
3. **Organized Folders**: Use dedicated folders for different purposes
4. **Universal Tools**: Prefer Cargo features over external scripts

### Code Organization Rules 📐
**SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE - Each file should have ONE clear purpose:**

1. **`src/main.rs`**: ONLY entry point and basic argument parsing
2. **`src/game/`**: Game logic modules
   - `mod.rs` - Game module exports
   - `player.rs` - Player entity and movement
   - `map.rs` - Map system and collision detection
   - `state.rs` - Game state management
3. **`src/testing/`**: Testing framework modules
   - `mod.rs` - Testing module exports  
   - `runner.rs` - Test execution framework
   - `tests.rs` - Individual test implementations
4. **`src/cli.rs`**: Command line interface definitions
5. **`src/graphics/`**: Rendering and visual modules (future)
6. **`src/physics/`**: Physics and collision systems (future)

### File Size Limits 📏
- **main.rs**: Maximum 100 lines
- **Any module**: Maximum 300 lines
- **If exceeding limits**: Split into sub-modules immediately

### Module Dependencies 🔗
- **Clear hierarchy**: Higher-level modules import lower-level ones
- **No circular dependencies**: Use dependency injection if needed
- **Public interfaces**: Each module exports only what's needed externally

### Proper Project Structure

### Testing Strategy 🧪
**Cross-Platform Testing Rules:**

1. **Use Cargo Tests**: Primary testing through `cargo test`
2. **Integration Tests**: In `tests/` folder
3. **Platform Scripts**: Only in `scripts/` folder
4. **Automated CI**: GitHub Actions for all platforms
5. **Manual Testing**: Clear procedures in docs

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run with verbose output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run specific test
cargo test test_movement

# Build all platforms (future)
cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
cargo build --target x86_64-apple-darwin
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

### Development Commands
```bash
# Development (compile + run)
cargo run

# Build distribution
.\build_release.bat

# Manual release build
cargo build --release
# (exe will be in target/release/)
```

## 💡 **NOTES & DECISIONS**

### Why Rust over C++?
- Memory safety (no segfaults, buffer overflows)
- Modern tooling (Cargo vs manual dependency management)
- Great for learning systems programming
- Growing game development ecosystem
- macroquad framework is perfect for 2D/3D games

### Why macroquad?
- Simple API, perfect for learning
- Cross-platform (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- Handles graphics, input, audio in one package
- Good performance for 2D and simple 3D
- Active development and community

### Distribution Strategy
- Single executable approach (no installers)
- Platform-specific folders (win64, future: macos, linux)
- Clean distribution (no unnecessary files)

# Development Rules
- **Rule 1: Commit after every significant change.** After a successful build, a passing test, or a meaningful refactor, a git commit must be made. This prevents catastrophic loss of work and ensures a stable rollback point.

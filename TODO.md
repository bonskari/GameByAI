## 🚀 **NEXT IMMEDIATE TASKS** (Priority Order)

### Phase 2: Player Movement & Basic Game World
1. **[ ] Add Player Entity**
   - Add player position (x, y coordinates)
   - Add player rotation/direction
   - Draw player as a colored circle/dot on screen

2. **[ ] Implement WASD Movement**
   - W/S: Move forward/backward in facing direction
   - A/D: Turn left/right (rotate player)
   - Movement speed control
   - Smooth movement with delta time

3. **[ ] Mouse Look (Optional)**
   - Mouse movement controls player rotation
   - Lock cursor to window center
   - Sensitivity settings

4. **[ ] Basic 2D Map System**
   - Create simple grid-based map (array of walls/empty)
   - Define map dimensions (e.g., 20x20 grid)
   - Basic collision detection (can't walk through walls)

5. **[ ] 2D Top-Down View**
   - Render map as rectangles (walls = white, empty = black)
   - Show player position on the map
   - Mini-map style view for debugging

## 🗺️ **FUTURE PHASES** (Roadmap)

### Phase 3: 3D Raycasting Engine
- [ ] Implement raycasting algorithm
- [ ] Cast rays from player position
- [ ] Calculate wall distances
- [ ] Render vertical wall strips
- [ ] Basic 3D perspective view

### Phase 4: Graphics & Textures
- [ ] Wall textures (load image files)
- [ ] Texture mapping on walls
- [ ] Floor and ceiling rendering
- [ ] Sprite system for items/enemies

### Phase 5: Game Mechanics
- [ ] Enemy AI (simple follow player)
- [ ] Shooting system
- [ ] Health and damage
- [ ] Score system
- [ ] Sound effects

### Phase 6: Polish & Content
- [ ] Multiple levels/maps
- [ ] Menu system
- [ ] Settings (controls, graphics)
- [ ] Game save/load
- [ ] Improved graphics and effects

## 💡 **NOTES & DECISIONS**

### Why Rust over C++?
- Memory safety (no segfaults, buffer overflows)
- Modern tooling (Cargo vs manual dependency management)
- Great for learning systems programming
- Growing game development ecosystem
- macroquad framework is perfect for 2D/3D games

### Why macroquad?
- Simple API, perfect for learning
- Cross-platform (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- Handles graphics, input, audio in one package
- Good performance for 2D and simple 3D
- Active development and community

### Distribution Strategy
- Single executable approach (no installers)
- Platform-specific folders (win64, future: macos, linux)
- Clean distribution (no unnecessary files)

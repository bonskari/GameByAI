# Wolfenstein by AI - Development Session Log

## Session 1 - Initial Setup and Technology Decisions
**Date**: Current Session  
**Goal**: Set up development environment and create first working prototype

---

### 1. Project Initialization

**User Request**: "Setup git here and create a new repo to my github account"

**Actions Taken**:
- Explored empty directory structure
- Initialized git repository with `git init`
- Created basic README.md and .gitignore files
- Connected to GitHub remote: `git@github.com:bonskari/GameByAI.git`
- Successfully pushed initial commit

**Key Learning**: HTTPS worked better than SSH for initial setup

---

### 2. Technology Choice Exploration

**User Request**: "this should be a c++ project.. I want to you first create a hello world c++ project"

**Initial Approach**:
- Created main.cpp with Hello World program
- Set up Makefile for compilation
- Added C++-specific .gitignore patterns
- Successfully compiled with g++ (MinGW-W64 14.2.0)

**Critical Problem Discovered**:
- Console programs had visibility issues in this environment
- Executable created successfully but output wasn't visible
- User couldn't see "Hello World" when running .exe files

**Pivotal Question from User**: "What other options I have than a console program?"

**My Recommendation**:
- Suggested graphics libraries: SDL, SFML, OpenGL
- **Strongly recommended SDL** for Wolfenstein-style games

---

### 3. Major Technology Pivot

**User Question**: "Would it actually make more sense to start this project in rust?"

**Analysis Provided**:
- **Rust Advantages**: Memory safety, modern tooling (Cargo), growing game ecosystem
- **Rust Game Libraries**: Bevy, macroquad, ggez, rust-sdl2
- **Recommendation**: **Rust with macroquad** - ideal for learning and Wolfenstein-style games

**User Decision**: "ok lets go with rust.. im here to learn anyway."

**Key Insight**: This was the turning point - switching to Rust solved multiple problems at once

---

### 4. Rust Environment Setup

**Challenges Encountered**:
- Rust not initially installed
- Used `winget install --id Rustlang.Rustup` for installation
- PATH issues required manual addition: `$env:PATH += ";$env:USERPROFILE\.cargo\bin"`
- Had to refresh terminal environment multiple times

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Created cargo project with `cargo init --name wolfenstein-ai`
- Added macroquad dependency to Cargo.toml
- Updated .gitignore for Rust-specific patterns

---

### 5. First Working Graphics

**Code Created**:
- Implemented graphical "Hello World" using macroquad
- Features: Green title, white subtitle, ESC to exit, green border
- Async main function with proper game loop
- Real-time rendering at 60 FPS

**Major Success**: User confirmed "ah now it works.. very cool"

**Significance**: This was the breakthrough moment - we had actual graphics working!

---

### 6. Distribution and Build System

**User Insight**: "So im thinking this should be an exe or something rather than a bat file?"

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created `cargo build --release` for optimized executable (794KB)
- Professional build structure: `build/win64/` folder
- Automated build script: `build_release.bat`
- Clean distribution with just .exe and README.txt

**User Feedback**: "its very cool.. what do you suggest would be the next steps?"

---

### 7. Project Organization

**User Request**: "can you move the exe to a build folder that has win64 folder and always keep adding everything there that is needed for a distribution"

**Implemented Professional Structure**:
```
build/
└── win64/
    ├── wolfenstein-ai.exe (794KB standalone)
    ├── README.txt (user instructions)
    └── (removed unnecessary LAUNCH_GAME.bat per user feedback)
```

**Key Decisions**:
- Single executable approach (no installers)
- Platform-specific folders for future expansion
- Clean distribution (no unnecessary files)

---

### 8. User Experience Insights

**User Question**: "do I need any bat files in the build folder?"

**Response**: Simplified to just .exe + README.txt approach
- Professional game distribution standard
- Easier for users (just double-click .exe)
- Cleaner and less confusing

---

### 9. Documentation and Continuity

**User Request**: "can you write down the plan of everything now to a to-do.md file or something. So I can restart my computer and you know what you should be doing next"

**Created Comprehensive Documentation**:
- TODO.md with complete roadmap
- Phase-based development plan
- Technical decisions documented
- Session continuity system

**Follow-up Request**: "can you also record a full log of this conversation and make it an ai.log file"

**Result**: This AI.log file for complete context preservation

---

## Key Technical Decisions Made

### Language Choice: Rust over C++
**Reasoning**:
- Memory safety eliminates common game programming bugs
- Cargo toolchain is significantly easier than C++ build systems
- macroquad provides better beginner experience than SDL setup
- Modern language features and ecosystem
- Cross-platform by default

### Graphics Framework: macroquad over SDL/OpenGL
**Reasoning**:
- Simple API perfect for learning
- Handles window management, input, rendering in one package
- Great for both 2D and basic 3D (perfect for Wolfenstein-style)
- Active development and good documentation
- Zero-setup approach (no complex dependencies)

### Build Strategy: Single Executable Distribution
**Reasoning**:
- No installation required for users
- All dependencies statically linked
- Professional game distribution approach
- Easy to share and test
- Platform-specific folders for future expansion

## Problems Solved

1. **Console Output Visibility**: Switched from console to graphics
2. **Complex C++ Setup**: Rust + Cargo simplified everything
3. **Build System Complexity**: Automated with simple batch script
4. **Distribution Messiness**: Clean folder structure with only essentials
5. **Development Continuity**: Comprehensive documentation system

- ✅ Graphical window with macroquad
- ✅ Text rendering and UI
- ✅ Input handling (ESC to exit)
- ✅ Proper game loop and timing
- ✅ Standalone executable distribution
- ✅ Professional build system
- ✅ Git version control with GitHub

**User Satisfaction**: High - "its very cool"

**Ready for Next Phase**: Player movement implementation (WASD controls)
